I had started making the 7-1. I need to find out what to do  about the dark/light mode. likely sass will be helpful. Use variables and if statements based
on whether the slider is on 
    if on, X variable active, if off, its display none?

	3/23

	Need to work on the toggle button

	fixded SOME of the javascript. and migrated the css to proper files and trimmer down. now need to make an if staement and variables for
	the day/night mode code

5/14 Need to replace a lot 
	update the code
	make new sections
	

	the code issues
	need to have 1 version of sections, not 2
	get rid of onclick
	need to have section names, not everything be div
	

	need to input the js oode to make the menus work



	5/15

	Have changed some html code. need to download site screenshots and use for personalsite


5/16

I noticed that there were two different eleements with the id of name. was that the reason, so long ago that I could not get the forms to work?

I also saw a stray </input> tag. 

Use html validators more

do I make <li> otu fo the portfolio stuff?

replaced "clickhere" with "websitelink"

worked on replacing the sites shown visually. also improved tags. 
will need to switch over and fix the css for everything now. maybe need old version of the code for comparison
also, clean up the shortcuts page for my folders


5/18


I did a lot to give everything their owns sections and have the right styling

I need to center the into AND get rid of the "first" of the top sections
Have each of the portfolio pieces be equalish size.
center the about section in responsive.
reqrite the about section in responsive


5/19

to even everything out, it seems like I might have to use flex-grow or flex-shrink

I need to either have the buttons the same distance from the bottom
	issue: the long paragraph causes blockage

OR 

I can have the paragraphs take up the same amount of text
	issue: how can they be compared to each other? they are cousins
		unles the comparison is with flexboxes as a whole

The desperate plan is to simple sheink the description length.



an issue is that the default heaer location is <header>. the pc one is <ul topbar>

I need them to be identical

somewhat fused together. need to make links

5/19

links done. fairly easy with importing.
next need to make dropdown menu 
the current code is spilling over into the navbar section. remove and move some to the menusliding section, the part that defines the shape of the
menu. that way, the animations can be added.

also, be careful about the menu template from the menu project. If I want the menu to dropdown from the top inside of the side, I will need to do
some things differently.

And I will need to add the code so the sliding and the responsiveness work.

Also, don't forget the variables to switch between modes.

25min


add more to the nacbar for mobile. integrate the animation. remmber yhe menu is dosplay none
make sure the color changes with hover over

connect the menu with the javascript


5/20 ctrl+j end terminal

I added in the menu. It also successfully will send to the right section

I need to seperate the javascript code into 2 parts: one that concerns the opening menu, and one that concerns the links further below.
One issue is formatting the opening. I have realied that the code for this site, the mexican site, and the edfault menu all look different.
I need to figure out what is best.

With the issue of the menu items being spaced properly, PART of the issue can be solved with proper padding. I just need to deal with some ofht etitles
being too long. when they responsively change, that alters the menu


greatly improved menu. need to adjust the responsiveness of the hamburger AND the ratio of the skills logos

5/22

Done. Now for links, do I make an array with a for loop? Sounds right.
or do I give hrefs to everything?

tried making a link. got 

Content-Security-Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource (img-src) at http://127.0.0.1:5500/favicon.ico because it violates the following directive: “default-src 'none'”




5/23 

The issue was incorrcet variable declaration.
also. note the difference ebtween

    window.open(thehref)
    window.location.href= (thehref)

do the burger

added some padding

js issues lines 70,235 menu
Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "setAttribute", MenuButton[i] is undefined



the header and the navbar need to be seperate because of responsiveness.
make sure to have the burger icon removed with responsiveness.
	likely has to do with the "show" class

fixed formatting with my name. 



issue: in the menu template, the default_menu_wrapper controls the spacing of those top elements. it stays when things are default.
in mine, it is controlling the appearance of the sliding menu. need to be gone by default.
Need to seperate the 2

figured out the proper code from the template


but NOW, the buttons on the menu arent working 
Uncaught ReferenceError: getElementPositionRelativeToDocument is not defined menu.js:158:34
Uncaught ReferenceError: MenuArray is not defined menu.js:250:25



top,intro,and skills buttons all work

<a class="section header__responsivemenu--item" type="button" data-button="responsivemenuitem" href="index.html#openingsection">
menu.js:191:9
<h1 id="portfoliotitle" class="subtitle" data-subheader="skills">
menu.js:143:11
1083 is the toprelativetodocument menu.js:147:11
offsetposition 898  is 85 minus 1083

	an issue is that the tites and the links are all 1 off distorted
		ex, click top go to intro
		click intro go to skills
		at portfolio on, there is nothing

	need to be more descriminating in terms of what the subsections of the website are called

	have the sections be based on some header vs subheader. that is what is being scrolled to

Need to get the danafreitas.com to because clickable. and issue is that top and danafreitas link to the same thing

have it operate seperately?

got rid of the top button.
problem still there. need to altar the danafreitas.com?
haev better console.logs to help find the problem. trim some fat

it mostly works. an issue that that contact-> intro doesnt scroll all the way.
issue may be related how how there are multiple(n+1) loops instead of 1
	add a counter?
	did, the count is n+1 no matter what. is a problem for efficiency, but seperate from the intro problem


5/24

I cant have loops in loops. 

the default/responsivescrolls are only happening once.
The issues are starting later.
responsivescroll is looping the button several times because of the for loop in there. 



issues with toprelativetodocument because
its being held relative to the top of the docuemnt, not the target element

I managed to figure out the issue. I had deleted a section that described the titles, but I readded it.

Now I need to figure out intro

Figured out. What I needed to do was to have the location of the evt declared early on. I could just do the scrolling on that AND I didnt have
an n2 O complexty.

HAving trouble updating to github. may be internet trouble.

I think it is because my page shows New branch instread of main. need to switch.

git push --force origin main can be used

PS C:\Users\danar\WebDevProjects\PersonalSite> git branch --all 
  main
  master
* update
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/update

  need to changed checked out branch?

did git checkout main and
need to
 switcged brancges

how do I commit or stash this text file?


5/25 

I think I was pushing to the wrong thing, main instead of update.

I need to have a way to switch dark and light mode

I need to use toggle to do this. 
WIll ddo by hving an extra class setle, X__lightmode. IT doesnt exist on the elements at first, but the toggle will make it exist and override 
the first thing.

trying to toggle the lightmode switches on css. The isssue is 

Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "toggle", theme.classlist is undefined

I define that with...why is it undefined?

title__lightmode is ALWAYS tseting false, even when I try to trigger it.
and why false nd not true? I wrote doen the code. must be a connection


5/26

I fixed "section" which has been missing a closing bracket

Needed to replace it. but an issue is that daymode section ISNT a section.
...It needs to be next to my name

Have the hover effect go next to the dadymode as well
I needed to finagle with the size to have it be parallele to my name

the console.log works. need the functions to. 


//let datatheme = document.querySelector("[data-theme]")
//let datatheme = document.dataset.theme;
which one?


html.dataset.datatheme = "dark";
didnt work
datatheme = "dark";
did

maybe fix some of the names. i think I got mixed up between theme and datatheme


<a  class="nav__button"
          type="button"
          data-location="defaulttag"
          id="themebutton"
          > Daymode</a
          >
const theme = document.getElementById("themebutton");
	
<html lang="en" data-theme="light"
 id="html">

let datatheme = html.dataset.theme;



change const theme to ---> themebutton
change data-theme to ----> data-themecolor
let datatheme be ---> themecolor


fixed. need to be more careful with the variable names

5/27

Do some element nesting, especially in navbar


I was thinking....maybe im too focused on best practices I can worry about next time instead of delivering what is needed. maybe, I can focus more on
nesting and best way to color swap later.

Maybe I dont need to swap color palletes?

KISS
